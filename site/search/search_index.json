If you are not a dedicated network card, you usually do not need to change the configuration here. You can add up to 10 records to the dial-up parameter set.</p> <p>Network Mode: The network mode of the cell, you can choose 3G, 4G and other related network mode, such as LTE, WCDMA, etc. If it is not clear which network mode to choose, select automatic; The program will automatically select the most appropriate network mode. The default is automatic.</p> <p>Enable Default Route: Enable the add default route function, when enabled, when the dial is successful, it will add a default route of the cellular port. The default route is enabled.</p> <p>Metric: This is the metric for the default routing of the cellular port. When default routing is configured on the cellular, Wi-Fi, and Ethernet ports, the metric with the lowest value is used.</p> <p></p> <p>Dual SIM Enabled: Dual Sim enabled. In order to improve the reliability of the network, EC300 supports dual SIM and single dial. Two sim cards need to be inserted into the device. If the sim1 card fails to dial because of unpaid charges, it will automatically switch to the sim2 card for dialing. By default, it is off.</p> <p>Main SIM: The main sim card, when dialing, the selected sim card will be preferred for dialing. When dialing fails to reach a certain number of times, when switching to another sim card for dialing, the default is to use sim1 for dialing.</p> <p>Max Number of Dials: When the dual-SIM single-dial function is enabled, the current sim card will be dialed to another sim card for dialing when the number of dials reaches a specified number.</p> <p>APN Profile: sim card selected dialing parameters set, the default value is automatic.

It is recommended that customers with cellular connections enable ICMP probing so that false connections can be quickly recovered.</p> <p>ICMP probe parameters:</p> <p>ICMP Detection Server Probes: ICMP probe address; 2 probe addresses can be configured, as long as 1 address is successfully probed, it means that there is no fake connection in the cell. When neither address is configured, ICMP probe is off.</p> <p>Detection Interval: How often should ICMP probes be performed?</p> <p>Detection Timeout: The duration of ICMP probe timeout. If no probe response packet is received, the probe is considered to have failed.</p> <p>Detection Max Retries: the maximum number of probes; When a probe fails to reach this value, a redial is triggered. Range [1,5]</p> <p>Detection Strict: Whether strict detection is enabled. When strict detection is turned off, the detection program will detect whether the packet received by the cellular interface has changed in each detection cycle. If there is a change, it means that the cellular network is working, and ICMP packets will not be sent for detection, so as to save some traffic; If the probe is turned on, ICMP probe packets will be sent periodically regardless of whether the number of packets received by the cellular interface has changed.

Since dialing is enabled by default, some customers without sim card, dialing failure, the system will restart, in this case, you can open unlimited redialing; In this way, no matter how many times the dialing fails, the system will not restart.</p> <p>Dial Interval; But if a dial fails, the amount of time to wait before making another dial.</p> <p>Signal Query Interval: Signal query interval.
